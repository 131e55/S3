```

``` Swift

let url = URL.init(fileURLWithPath: "/Users/pro/Dropbox/books/agile-android-software-development.pdf")
try s3.put(fileAtUrl: url, filePath: "books/agile-android-software-development.pdf", bucketName: "booststore", accessControl: .publicRead)

```
{
   "accessKey": "{your-AWS-accees-key}",
   "secretKey": "{your-AWS-secret-key}"
}
```

### Troubleshooting

##### I am getting a ```badResponse``` error and my credentials are correct
* Check if you don't need to set your region, it's one of the optional methods on all put methods

##### I do all by the book and that crap still doesn't work!!! üê∑ üí© 
* Go to Vapor slack channel and ask for @rafiki270, you can scream at him

##### I got some other problems or improvements
* Send a merge request, create an issue, Slack me on Vapor channel, @rafiki270
